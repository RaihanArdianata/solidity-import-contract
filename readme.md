- section 1 deploy contract with another contract
    simple how does storage factory know what simple storage looks like?  if StorageFactory going to deploy SimpleStorage its going need to know the code,
    one way u can do this we can actualy copy all code from SimpleStorage.sol underneed version and mit license then paste to StorageFactory.sol then u can compile 
    single file solidity and one file sol can hold diff contract, note : have masive chunk of code it little bit redundant
